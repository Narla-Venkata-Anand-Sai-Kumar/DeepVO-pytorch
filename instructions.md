# Additional Instruction to run the model


1. Downloader of image is quite straigtforward. Just have to make sure images are saved in `/vol/bitbucket/mc620/DeepVO/KITTI`

2. Adjust parameters in the `param.py` file, make sure file path is changed. 

3. Dependancies include 

- python3.7
- pytorch 0.4.0
- torchvision 0.2.1
- numpy
- pandas
- Pillow < 7.0.0
- matplotlib

python3.7 can be installed using pyenv. pytorch 0.4.0 is too old, nearest working version is installed with `pip3 install torch==1.0.0`

4.
